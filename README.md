This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon Perl bug involving array index out-of-bounds errors.  The `bug.pl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version using safe array access techniques.  This is a common error in many languages, and Perl is no exception. Always check array bounds before accessing elements to prevent unexpected behavior and potential crashes.
